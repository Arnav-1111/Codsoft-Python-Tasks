## CodeSoft Internship - Python Projects

This repository contains three Python projects completed during my internship at CodeSoft:

1. Calculator: A simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations.
2. To-Do List: A program that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks from a to-do list.
3. Password Generator: A tool that generates strong, random passwords with customizable length and character sets.

### Project Descriptions

1. Calculator (calculator/calculator.py)

• This script implements a basic calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
• Users can input two numbers and select the desired operation.
• The script then performs the calculation and displays the result.

2. To-Do List (to-do-list/to-do.py)

• This script allows users to manage a to-do list through a menu-driven interface.
• Users can add new tasks, view existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
• The to-do list is stored in a text file for persistence.

3. Password Generator (password_generator/generator.py)

• This script generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
• Users can specify the desired password length and choose from various character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
• The script generates a unique password and displays it to the user.
